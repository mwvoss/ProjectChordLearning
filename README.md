Abstract: Evidence from tasks that primarily tap either hippocampal- or striatal-based memory systems suggests that although these systems often compete for control of behavior, aging is associated with greater cooperation between them. This may stem from altered prefrontal cortex function. Here we use a configural response task designed to engage both memory systems to test how age affects their interaction with cortical regions including the prefrontal cortex. We found that while older and younger adults learned just as well, older adults showed greater initial activation in cortical networks associated with visuospatial-action mapping and resolving conflict for competing memory representations. Older adults also showed greater functional coupling of the striatum with the left inferior frontal gyrus, in parallel with similar hippocampal coupling to ventral visual regions as young adults. Overall, our results support the proposal that aging is associated with more cooperative memory systems, but we did not find that greater cooperation is associated with less interaction between the prefrontal cortex and core memory system structures during learning.
